const about = `${chalk.bgGreen("A brief summary of me:")}

Starting my career off with Principal Asset Management Berhad (PAMB) as a Junior Business Process Engineer specializing in integrating Robotic Processes Automation (RPA) into business models in order to maximize workload without human intervention. We managed to deploy a successfully operated program with several stakeholders and the projection of several projects to follow suit that was in the process.

Left PAMB and joined DHL APSSC as a Junior Associate in Data Management dept. with 1+ years of experience specializes in SVC's outbound and inbound. During the time, my team and I managed to accelerate a staggering number of France Export Backlogs shipments at custom through a system
called DHL Central Engine (DCE).

Left DHL APSSC and Joined Ambank Berhad as a backoffice IT system support for our e-banking application called AmOnline. **Executed testing and staging deployments, ensuring the successful evaluation of software and applications prior to production release. Successfully deployed production environment migration during September release update to our e-banking application**

Left DHL APSSC, I transitioned to a position at Ambank Berhad, where I served as a back-office IT system support for our e-banking application, AmOnline. In this role, I honed my skills and expertise in system support, focusing on a range of responsibilities that were critical to the smooth operation of the application. One of my primary tasks was executing testing and staging deployments. This involved a comprehensive process to ensure the successful evaluation of software and applications before they were released to production. 

Finding passion in writing codes, during the year of my career break before I joined Ambank, I decided to break my way into the industry learning, improving and self-progressing each and every day. I focus on front-end developing at the moment. While coding is all fun, I started to dive into data analytics as well by immersing in SQL, Tableau and python. Having the knowledges in these area, I have created several portfolio projects for each of the tools(you can find them on my ùóöùó∂ùòÅùóµùòÇùóØ account). 

I believe that finding solutions on the internet doesn't make me a bad developer because it actually helped me a lot to understand and figure out my own work around to apply those bit of code to my own.  

I am well-versed and proficient in a range of tools that are essential in the field of web development and programming. These include HTML, CSS, Javascript, nodeJS, TailwindCSS, SASS, React, nextJS, Git and Github.

On the other hand, as an avid learner in language learning, I have always find myself immersed in Spanish, German and Swedish language. I am able understand contexts in these languages however with limited capability in speaking them. Regardless, practice makes improvement! With these 3 foreign languages, I found learning language opens up windows of vast opportunities to connect ourselves with people globally. Looking forward to use my ability in foreign languages at its fullest capacity in the future.

Currently I am actively seeking a front-end dev/data analyst/database engineer position and looking forward to gain more experiences and knowledges to equip myself to work with some of the best tech companies globally.

Feel free to [contact me via LinkedIn or email](https://www.notion.so/Contact-me-2396d2d8669c435bb7b439c53c3a4154?pvs=21). I'm always looking forward for an insightful conversations or working opportunities!`;
